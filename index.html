        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="profileInfo">
          I was a Software Quality Assurance Analyst and Product Specialist
          before considering being a Full-stack Developer, considered studying
          automation testing to be more competitive in the field of IT testing
          but suddenly got interested in going back to coding applications
          especially web development where I can use my knowledge on Quality
          Assurance.

          <h3>Software Quality Assurance</h3>
          <p>
            I have an experience in testing mobile games using android and ios
            devices because of my previous job in Elevated Play Philippines.
            Inc., while with the company the tools we commonly used with our
            developers abroad are google spreadsheets for creating and following
            our test cases and JIRA for bug monitoring, patch checking and
            regression testing. My next work experience would be with CARD MRI
            Information Technology Inc., where I was hired as a Software Quality
            Assurance Analyst responsible for creating test cases, actual
            testing, and coordinating with our product specialist in regards to
            analyzing concerns from our partner institutes regarding the
            application we developed for them.

            Technology Inc., we were suffering from a lack of manpower were as a
            Software Quality Assurance Analyst I was given the responsibility of
